These provide a high-level interface for tabular data analysis and are better optimized for that use. For instance, the C-struct-like memory layout of structured arrays in numpy can lead to poor cache behavior in comparison.\n","\n","You are find out more [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.16.1/user/basics.rec.html)"]}]}
